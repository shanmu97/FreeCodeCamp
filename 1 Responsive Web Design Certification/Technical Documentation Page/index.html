        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.</p> <p>Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

<li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
<li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). </li><li>For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li></ul>
<p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.</p> 
<p>Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:

<p>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. </p>
<p>For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</p>
<p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>

<p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). </p>
<p>Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>

<p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. </p>
<p>You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
