# FreeCodeCamp
Building web pages is so exciting! I have recently heard about freecodecamp website which offers free certifications on static web development. So, I started practicing the course through this website. There are good projects for every topic. In this repo, I will be uploading my code files that completes the certification for the references.

## Responsive Web Design
In this Responsive Web Design Certification, I have learnt the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design . Gained Experience by building many projects using only HTML and CSS. There are 20 projects in this certification course. Throughout this program, I acquired a strong grounding in web development, mastering the art of crafting responsive and aesthetically pleasing web pages. The curriculum encompassed:
- HTML5 semantics and structure
- CSS3 styling and layout techniques
- Responsive design principles
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Best practices for web development
